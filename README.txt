Project: Smart Water Level Indicator

Author: PURVA BHATI

ðŸ”§ Components:

Arduino Uno

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

3x LEDs (Green, Yellow, Red)

3x 220-ohm resistors

Buzzer

LCD Display (16x2 I2C)

ðŸ“– Description:

This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to monitor the water level in a tank. It provides visual and audible alerts via LEDs and a buzzer, and displays water level on an LCD.

ðŸ’¡ Features:

Real-time water level detection

LED indicators for 3-level alert (LOW, MEDIUM, FULL)

Audible alert using buzzer when tank is full

LCD display shows water level percentage

Simple and fast to build and simulate
